# Cashless Tips Platform (Az-QR)

**Cashless tipping made simple.**  
A QR-based platform enabling street performers and service workers in **Azerbaijan** (and later globally) to receive instant, secure digital tips via Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank cards.

## 🎯 Mission
As cash usage declines, performers and workers lose spontaneous support. Our mission:  
**Bridge the "generosity gap"** by offering the fastest and most trusted way to tip — ensuring **100% of the intended tip reaches the artist.**
